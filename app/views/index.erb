  <h3 class="subhead2"> Who are We? </h3> 
  <p class="para">We are a group of students who made this website to inspect the worlds around us. We want to explain our interests that are “out of this world”. We are exploring topics that not too many people are familiar with. We want people to have a knowledgeable lifestyle so they can be aware of how incredible this life is, and the chance for more.</p> 
  
  <h3 class="subhead2"> Our Goal </h3> 
  <p class="para">Our goal is to educate people about astronomy as well as a bit more background in astrology. A lot of people are skeptical about these things, but when you read a bit more into it you see that these things can actually describe you. We want people to be aware of their identity and how to understand things about our universe. We don’t want you “spacing out” anymore.</p>
